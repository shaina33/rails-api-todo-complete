## React ToDo App with Rails API

The Rails portion of the application was cloned from shannonio/rails-api-todo-complete, and developed by the team at Linchpin Industries, LLC.

I integrated the Rails API with a new React app using create-react-app and a wonderful tutorial from Fullstack React (https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/).

Further development work is my own.
